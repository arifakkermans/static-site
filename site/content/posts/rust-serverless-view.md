## Introduction
Rust is a programming language that is gaining popularity due to its performance, safety, and reliability. This year I've also decided to explore Rust and the different use cases it could have.

The language's focus on memory management and the use of the borrow checker make it a great choice for writing high-performance, scalable, and maintainable code. However, it's important to understand the role Rust plays and to have the right reasons for choosing it over other languages.

One of the main benefits of Rust is its performance. The language is specifically designed to keep memory usage low and to only use it when it's needed, resulting in faster and more efficient code. Additionally, Rust's goal is to write code that can run reliably for decades and still work on another computer with a different architecture. This makes Rust a great choice for writing code that is maintainable for a long time and can run for a long time.

Another benefit of Rust is its safety and reliability. The language's strict rules and the use of the borrow checker make it less likely for code to break at runtime. This, combined with Rust's ability to be scalable in both runtime and architecture, makes it a great choice for writing large and complex code bases.

## Serverless?
While Rust's performance, safety, and reliability make it a great choice for certain types of projects, it may not always be the best choice for serverless architectures. One of the main benefits of serverless is its ability to handle short-lived functions, such as those used in AWS Lambda. This means that even if a function has a memory leak, it will only affect the function for a short period of time before it is terminated and replaced with a new instance. This can make the impact of memory leaks less significant in a serverless environment. Additionally, Rust's focus on long-term reliability may not be as important in serverless architectures where functions are constantly being terminated and replaced.

It's also worth noting that using Rust in a serverless environment may require additional work in terms of building and deploying the code. While there are crates available to build and deploy rust functions to Lambda, it is still not as mature as other languages and may require more work to get it set up.

On the other hand, JavaScript has traditionally had some issues such as performance, safety, and reliability. However, recent advancements in the language and related technologies have addressed many of these issues. For example, the V8 engine has greatly improved JavaScript's performance, and the use of TypeScript has helped improve safety. The rise of serverless architectures and tools like esbuild, turbo pack, and turbo repo have made it easier to handle large code bases.

In conclusion, Rust is a valuable language to learn due to its performance, safety, and reliability. However, it's important to understand the role it plays and to have the right reasons for choosing it over other languages. With recent advancements in JavaScript and related technologies, it's becoming easier to achieve similar results without the need to learn a new language.
