*   [Clean Code](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3735293-clean-code) **by Robert C. Martin (2008)**. This is  a book you keep around for the rest of your career. There is so much conversation in Software Engineering around Data structures and Algorithms, optimization and efficiency that are all geared to making great software. However, there isn't much information about how software engineers can get to the place to write great code. The simple answer is by building great habits. This book defines rules and principles which you could follow to write clean, readable, maintainable, and elegant code. (â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†)
*   [The Ride of a Lifetime](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44525305-the-ride-of-a-lifetime?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=G2vOOwgds8&rank=1) **by Robert Iger (2021)**. The book is generally about leadership lessons while he writes the story about his time at Disney. We follow the story in chronically order about how Bob managed to secure the big acquisitions made when he was the CEO of Disney (Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and 20th Century Fox). A surprising personal touch was his relationship with Steve Jobs, I had no idea how close the two were. What I found particularly arresting is how he worked himself up, from the lower class, over succeeding at ABC to ultimately becoming a CEO at Disney and earning around 66 million US-dollar a year.
