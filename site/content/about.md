# Hello! I'm Arif ðŸ‘‹

A climber, calisthenics lover, traveler, and a Cloud Engineer who is currently part of the AWS platform team at [VodafoneZiggo](https://www.vodafoneziggo.nl/en/): a Dutch company offering fixed, mobile and integrated communication and entertainment services to consumers and businesses.

I'm an Engineer with experience designing and implementing large-scale solutions in AWS Landing Zones (+100 Accounts). I started my career as a Linux administrator and Security engineer, but I quickly fell in love with the Cloud-Native world, and evolved to Cloud Engineer roles. During my journey, I participated in multiple projects with different technologies, which gave me enough room to build a diverse and strong fundament of skills in Networking, Operating systems and Software Development.

When I learn about interesting software development and Serverless topics, I will write about it here.
