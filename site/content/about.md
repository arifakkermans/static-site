# Hello! I'm Arif 👋

A climber, calisthenics lover, traveler, and a Cloud Engineer who is currently part of the AWS platform team at [PostNL](https://www.postnl.nl/en/): the national provider of postal and parcel services in the Netherlands. We work closely with national postal services and private delivery partners in order to offer customers the most comprehensive and reliable network for delivery of their mail, packets and parcels – not just in the Netherlands but also abroad.

I'm an Engineer with experience designing and implementing large-scale solutions in AWS Landing Zones (+500 Accounts). I started my career as a Linux administrator and Security engineer, but I quickly fell in love with the Cloud-Native world, and evolved to Cloud Engineer roles. During my journey, I participated in multiple projects with different technologies, which gave me enough room to build a diverse and strong fundament of skills in Networking, Operating systems and Software Development.

When I learn about interesting software development and Serverless topics, I will write about it here.
